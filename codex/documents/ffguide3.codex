"In addition to stats normally present in Starbound, FU adds a host of its own as well. Some may be character stats, some may be weapon stats. Some may be both! They are detailed within this guide for easy access later.\n
^green;Charisma^white; - When shopping on FU space stations, Charisma helps you to make a profit by influencing ^cyan;Selling and Buying^reset; values. A high charisma means a high income ratio! Note that this only applies on Space Station trades and their related Kiosks for the time being. As a special note, every 33% charisma will allow you to bring an additional crewmember with you in the field. Be warned, penalties to charisma can have the opposite effect!\n
^green;Stun Chance^white; - With blunt weapons, each critical hit has a chance to stun enemies. Likewise with successful shieldbashes. This stat influences the chance that this stun will occur.\n
^green;Shieldbash Chance^white; - When blocking with your shield, you have a chance to shieldbash. This stat influences the chances that the bash succeeds.\n
^green;Shieldbash Push^white; - How far a shieldbash will push an enemy, and how much damage it will inflict when successful.\n
^green;Projectile Count^white; - Typically only seen as a stat on weapons, it is indicated in most gun tooltips by 3 diagonally aligned bullets. This indicates how many projectiles are fired at once.\n
^green;Burst Count^white; - Exclusively on weapons. Indicated in the tooltip by a spread of 4 small bullets. These weapons fire a burst of projectiles in sequence.\n
^green;Tech Bonus^white; - There are various types of Tech Bonus. These will be listed when relevant. Any such bonus will influence techs. For example 'Jump Tech +25%' increase the efficiency of any Jump related techs by that amount.\n
^green;Weapon Mastery^white; - Occasionally you'll find gear that can grant 'Weapon Mastery' at different levels. Weapon Mastery provides additional benefits to particular weapons.\n
^green;Crit Chance^white; - The likelihood that you will score a successful critical attack with your weapon. Note that this can be a stat on both you -and- on a weapon. They will combine.\n
^green;Crit Damage Bonus^white; - The total bonus applied, in percentage, to critical damage strikes.\n
^green;Leech^white; - A form of healing that is unaffected by normal healing modifiers. This healing is divided over a duration (10 seconds at base); +10% leech means you will heal up to 1% of your health per second for 10 seconds per instance.\n
^green;Maximum Leech^white; - The maximum amount of healing you can have at a time, from leech. The default is 10%; from all leech instances you will not be able to heal more than 10% of your health per second.\n
^#e43774;Madness^white; - A measurement of your current sanity. The higher the value, the crazier you are. More than 50 effects can occur from madness, and not all are bad. You can spend Madness in the ^#e43774;Metaphysics Research Tree^reset;.\n
